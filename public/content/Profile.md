- Hi, my name is Adaora. 
- I'm a cloud engineer.
- I'm a computer science graduate with a strong foundation in technology, I've embarked on an exciting journey into the world of cloud engineering. Armed with an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and an insatiable passion for cloud architecture, I'm currently focused on attaining the AWS Solutions Architect certification

## About
My approach to learning cloud architecture involves drawing analogies that make complex cloud concepts more relatable and accessible. Just as a skilled architect designs and builds structures that stand the test of time, I aim to design and build cloud solutions that are efficient, scalable, and resilient. In the cloud, I see a canvas where I can use digital 'bricks' and 'blueprints' to create innovative solutions that elevate businesses to new heights.

I'm committed to staying at the forefront of cloud technology, learning new services and best practices, and leveraging my computer science background to solve real-world challenges in the cloud. With every cloud project, I'm not just building applications; I'm crafting digital ecosystems that empower businesses to thrive in the modern, interconnected world.
